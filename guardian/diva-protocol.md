# Audit Scope & Methodology

## Scope
The following smart contracts were in scope for the audit:
* [diva-contracts/contracts/*](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/tree/main/diva-contracts)
* [oracles/DIVAOracleTellor.sol](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/main/oracles/contracts/DIVAOracleTellor.sol)

(excluding [diva-contracts/contract/mocks](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/tree/main/diva-contracts/contracts/mocks) & [diva-contracts/contract/test](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/tree/main/diva-contracts/contracts/test))

## Methodology

The auditing process pays special attention to the following considerations:
- Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.
- Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.
- Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.
- Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.
- Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by community auditors.

### <a id="C01"></a> C-01 Round-down calculation is used to calculate the `_collateralAmountRemovedNetMaker` which can be abused by taker to take all the removed liquidity from maker

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibEIP712.sol#L855-L857

#### Description:
In the function `LibEIP712._fillOfferRemoveLiquidityLib()`, the variable `_collateralAmountRemovedNetMaker` is calculated using a round-down calculation. By splitting the `_offerRemoveLiquidity.makerCollateralAmount` into small enough parts, the taker can make the value of `_collateralAmountRemovedNetMaker` become 0, which means the maker gains nothing in every "remove liquidity" call.

For instance,
* `_offerRemoveLiquidity.positionTokenAmount = 100`
* ` _offerRemoveLiquidity.makerCollateralAmount = 10`

Calling `LibEIP712._fillOfferRemoveLiquidityLib()` with `_collateralAmountRemovedNet = 5` results in the returned amount for the maker being 5 * 10 / 100 = 0. The taker can repeat this process 20 times to steal all the returned amount of the maker.

#### Impact 
Taker can take all of the maker's returned collateral.

#### Recommendation:
Consider calculating the collateral returned for the taker first. The remaining amount will be returned to the maker.

### <a id="H01"></a> H-01 Incorrect treasury is used for fee allocation when removing liquidity

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L780-L785

#### Description:
In the function LibDIVA._removeLiquidityLib(), the fee is allocated for LibDIVAStorage._governanceStorage().treasury instead of the current treasury which is fetched by calling LibDIVA._getCurrentTreasury(). This may be the new treasury that has not yet passed the activation time.

#### Impact 
Since the protocol is fully decentralized, with the owner determined through a voting mechanism, the previous owner may experience a significant loss due to incorrect fee allocation for a period of two days.


#### Recommendation:
Modify lines [780->785](https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L780-L785) as follows: 
```soldiity=
 _allocateFeeClaim(
    _removeLiquidityParams.poolId,
    _pool,
    _getCurrentTreasury(gs), /// change here 
    _protocolFee
);
```


#### Resolution: 

### <a id="H02"></a> H-02 The position token (long/short token) can't be minted for the address(0)

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L546-L553
https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L670-L677

#### Description:
Functions `createContingentPool` and `addLiquidity()` consider `longRecipient = 0x` or `shortRecipient = 0x` as valid inputs to enable conditional burn use cases as per the docs:
![](https://i.imgur.com/VhuWE18.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/sXCHtzA.png)

Both functions use the `IPositionToken(_shortToken).mint()` function to mint long/short tokens for the recipient. However, the PositionToken contract inherits from [ERC20.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) in the OpenZeppelin library, which will [revert](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/cf86fd9962701396457e50ab0d6cc78aa29a5ebc/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L252) if the minted address is `address(0)`. This will break the intended behavior of the protocol.

#### Recommendation:
Consider minting for the `0xdead` instead of `0x` in case of conditional burn. 

#### Resolution: 

### <a id="H03"></a> H-03 `_createContingentPoolLib` is suspicious of the reorg attack

#### Description:
The `_createContingentPoolLib` function creates a new pool and determines their ids using the counter `ps.poolId`. At the same time, block reorg may happen on any blockchain, especially with some sidechain like Polygon, Optimism, ...
* https://polygonscan.com/blocks_forked

Note that, reorg on Polygon happens really often in which some are > 5 minutes long. For instance, there was an incident of 5.5 minites long reorg on Feb-22-2023 
* https://polygonscan.com/block/39599624/f?hash=0x0b7e6c5e9fbae3e2dbd114e4836b52ffb1211820bf62bbbd3ddf859dd07c0fe1
![](https://i.imgur.com/DAuEUYs.png)

With the block reorg, the attacker can execute some malicious actions to steal users's fund. Here is an example: 
* Alice creates a new pool, and some users add liquidity to it 
* Bob sees that the network block reorg happens and calls `_createContingentPoolLib()`. Thus, it creates a pool with an id to which some users add liquidity to. Then some users 's transactions are executed and they will transfer funds to Bob's controlled pool.
* Now Bob can
    * set his own dataProvider to control the output in the way that he can get the profit 
    * steal the tip which should be claimed by Alice's provider 

#### Attack scenario 
Before the reorg 
* Alice creates a pool with id = 1 
* Cindy add liquidity / add tip to the pool with id = 1 

After the reorg
* Bob creates a pool with id = 1 
* Alice creates a pool with id = 2 (which should be a pool with id = 1)
* Cindy add liquidity / add tip to the pool with id = 1 which is controlled by Bob 
--> Cindy's fund is at risk.

#### Recommendation:
Determine the pool id as hash of the `_createPoolParams` and the creator's address. 

#### Resolution:

### <a id="M01"></a> M-01 Transferring a zero value amount may revert when creating a pool 

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L476-L480
https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L645-L649

#### Description:
When working with ERC20 tokens, some tokens (such as LEND) [revert when transferring a zero value amount](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers). However, the function `LibDIVA._createContingentPoolLib` always transfers an amount of collateral tokens equal to `_createPoolParams.collateralAmountMsgSender`, even when this value is equal to zero (indicating that msg.sender does not wish to transfer any tokens to create the pool). 

Note that there can be a situation when an user wants to make a new pool without transferring any tokens. It happens when a maker creates an EIP712 offer in which the taker will be the one who transfers all the funds to the pool (the amount that the taker transfers must be > 1e6). In this case, the create transaction will revert. 

#### Impact:
Users are unable to create a pool using certain collateral tokens without transferring any tokens.

#### Recommendation:
Just execute a transfer if `amount > 0`.

#### Resolution: 

### <a id="M02"></a> M-02 Lack of support for Fee-on-Transfer tokens 

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L475-L515

#### Description:There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts.
One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`. Note that these tokens doesn't violate the constraint of protocol's doc, they aren't rebasable: 
![](https://i.imgur.com/lTqhsik.png) 

Assume that the collateral token is a deflationary token, when a user transfers 10 tokens to the pool, he will get 10 shortToken + 10 longToken in return. When he try burn these 10 shortTokens + 10 longToken to get his tokens back, the transaction will revert. Because the actual amount that the pool receive is less than 10 tokens due to the deflationary mechanism. 

#### Recommendation:
Calculate the actual amount of receive token by calculating the difference of the token's balance before and after the transfer is excuted. 

#### Resolution:

### <a id="L01"></a> L-01 Redundant requirement when requiring the `collateralAmount > 1e6` when creating a pool. 

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/libraries/LibDIVA.sol#L602-L604

#### Description:
When creating a pool, the function `LibDiva._validateInputParamsCreateContingentPool()` forces the collateral amount must be larger or equal `1e6`. But this requirement can be bypass by withdrawing an amount tokens right after the creation. This make this requirement redundant.

#### Recommendation:
Remove the requirement if not necessary. 

#### Resolution: 

### <a id="L02"></a> L-02 Redundant check `block.timestamp > submissionEndTime`

https://github.com/GuardianAudits/DivaAudit/blob/5d0c7f6d854b65c2f723ac6bceea6bbd4edef37e/diva-contracts/contracts/facets/SettlementFacet.sol#L475

#### Description:
In the previous `if` block, it has a check whether `block.timestamp <= submissionEndTime`. So obviously in the `else` block, the `block.timestamp` is always larger than `submissionEndTime`, so the condition `block.timestamp > submissionEndTime` is redundant. 

#### Recommendation:
Remove the condition. 

#### Resolution:
